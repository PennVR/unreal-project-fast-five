CIS568 Project 2 Work Plan
Santiago Buenahora, Edward Cai, Alexander Chan, Davin Hazard, Anosha Minai

## Technical Requirements Time Estimate:

1. Arrow Shooting:
  * Hold bow: Change the starter gun to a bow ~ 2 hours
  * Shoot arrow (with button): change projectile to bow object ~ 2 hours
  * Shoot arrow (with motion): detect when the arrow is pulled back on the Vive controller and then shoot when it is let go ~ 10 hours
  * Make VR ready: test with Vive headset to make sure it “feels right” for VR ~4 hours
2. Teleportation: 
  * Change arrows: add option to change arrows that teleport instead of damaging the opponent ~ 4 hours
  * Teleportation arrow: implement something similar to the class demo with option of confirmation ~ 2 hours. 
  * Condition Testing: Set conditions for valid teleportation areas ~ 3 hours. 
  * Make VR ready: add camera effects to make sure it doesn’t cause motion sickness ~ 3 hours
3. Game Mechanics: 
  * Random power-ups: Create power-ups (possibly large arrow, explosives, slow) ~ 12 hours
  * Additional arrow types: bundled with above task
  * Radar and scatter arrow (like Hanzo’s) ~ 4 hours
  * Arrow disabling “special” arrows ~ 4 hours
  * Implementing win conditions: keep track of health and lives. End game when conditions are met ~ 4 hours
    *Time-based (most kills wins)
4. VR UX: 
  * Haptic feedback: vibrate controller when shoot arrow, vibrate controller when hit ~ 2 - 4 hours (no idea how to do this)
  * Visual feedback when hit ~ 2 - 4 hours
  * Arrow color switch: Change colors of arrows ~ 2 hours. 
  * Scoreboard
  * Multiplayer:
5. TOTAL: ~40 hours

## Teamwork Breakdown:
1. Santiago Buenahora: game environment, teleportation
2. Edward Cai: bow, shoot arrows, game environment
3. Alexander Chan: game mechanics, level design
4. Davin Hazard: VR UX, game environment, level design 
5. Anosha Minai:

Mechanics & Visual Style:
Win conditions: 3 lives, 100 health or time-based
Location based damage (headshots are OHKO, etc)
World appearance: cartoonish, with buildings (like Team Fortress: https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/12810491_f520.jpg)
